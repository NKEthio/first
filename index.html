        <h1>The Secret of Success</h1>
        <p> COMMERCE, EMPIRES AND UNIVERSAL religions eventually brought
            virtually every Sapiens on every continent into the global world we live
            in today. Not that this process of expansion and unification was linear or
            without interruptions. Looking at the bigger picture, though, the
            transition from many small cultures to a few large cultures and finally to
            a single global society was probably an inevitable result of the dynamics
            of human history.</p>
        <p> But saying that a global society is inevitable is not the same as saying
            that the end result had to be the particular kind of global society we now
            have. We can certainly imagine other outcomes. Why is English so
            widespread today, and not Danish? Why are there about 2 billion
            Christians and 1.25 billion Muslims, but only 150,000 Zoroastrians and
            no Manichaeans? If we could go back in time to 10,000 years ago and
            set the process going again, time after time, would we always see the
            rise of monotheism and the decline of dualism?
            We can’t do such an experiment, so we don’t really know. But an
            examination of two crucial characteristics of history can provide us with
            some clues.</p>
